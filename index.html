    <p>
        In a small town the population is p0 = 1000 at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by 2 <br>
        percent per year and moreover 50 new inhabitants per year come to live in the town. How many years does the town <br>
        need to see its population greater or equal to p = 1200 inhabitants?<br>
        <br>
        At the end of the first year there will be: <br>
        1000 + 1000 * 0.02 + 50 => 1070 inhabitants<br>
        <br>
        At the end of the 2nd year there will be: <br>
        1070 + 1070 * 0.02 + 50 => 1141 inhabitants (** number of inhabitants is an integer **)<br>
        <br>
        At the end of the 3rd year there will be:<br>
        1141 + 1141 * 0.02 + 50 => 1213<br>
        <br>
        It will need 3 entire years.<br>
        More generally given parameters:<br>
        <br>
        p0, percent, aug (inhabitants coming or leaving each year), p (population to surpass)<br>
        <br>
        the function nb_year should return n number of entire years needed to get a population greater or equal to p.<br>
        <br>
        aug is an integer, percent a positive or null floating number, p0 and p are positive integers (> 0)<br>
        <br>
        Examples:<br>
        nb_year(1500, 5, 100, 5000) -> 15<br>
        nb_year(1500000, 2.5, 10000, 2000000) -> 10<br>
        Note<br>
        Don't forget to convert the percent parameter as a percentage in the body of your function: if the parameter percent <br>
        is 2 you have to convert it to 0.02.<br>
